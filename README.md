## 🧠 What You'll Learn

This course is designed to give you **real-world Machine Learning skills**, covering:

- Python programming (focused for ML use-cases)
- Key libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Supervised & Unsupervised ML Models
- Neural Networks, Deep Learning with PyTorch
- CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers
- Real-world projects like House Price Prediction, Image Classifier, Chatbot, and Deployment

## ✅ Why This Course is Different

Unlike most online tutorials, this course:

- **Focuses on projects first**: You’ll build real ML applications, not just watch code.
- **Solves tutorial hell**: I guide you from theory ➜ code ➜ real deployment.
- **Includes deep dives** into PyTorch, Neural Nets, and deployment practices.
- **Includes project templates and reusable utils** to save you time.

No bloated theory. No complicated math upfront. Just code, practice, projects.
